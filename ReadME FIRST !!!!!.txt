Hello fellas, This is me , AkashDeep Shukla (a.k.a TheSlimAD or Akkiei ) . I am here just to guide you through the process in which you will learn to use this application. Before I proceed I should probably warn you that this is going to be very hard.

NAAHH!! just kidding... it's easy so just "pay attention" on the following things.

To establish a network connection through sockets, you need to create a server and after that; client(s).
So here are some of the points to remember:-

# If you are the one who is initiating the connection then you should run the "server.ex"  	        (TheVirgin_server.exe).
 
# Now don't loose patience, Iknow it takes time and trying to figure this out and probably patch it in next     version. 	
    It will ask you to enter your name in a black window (dude, it's cmd ).

# Now the other one (the one with whom you want to communicate ) needs to run "client.exe" and same     process will be followed.

# After entering name, client will enter the IP address of server. Now that's your problem how you send the       IP address to each-other. (I suggest you to use whatsapp ;)  )

# Voila !!! You are connected . A new window should pop-up by now.And now start sending messages.
